summary: Data-driven Surrogate Modeling of Structural Dynamical Systems.
abstract: 'High-fidelity simulation models provide insight into complex dynamical systems but are neither suitable for time critical applications nor for evaluation on resource limited hardware. This results in a high demand for efficient surrogate models that require less computational effort while retaining the most important aspects of the original model. 
Data based non intrusive model order reduction has emerged as a potent solution
to the task of creating efficient yet accurate surrogate models. In this talk we will discuss two related topics:
(i) a multi hierarchic graph convolutional surrogate modeling scheme, in which
surrogates are created on coarse representations of the model in an iterative manner, and
(ii) structure imposing discovery of low dimensional port Hamiltonian systems..'

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.
