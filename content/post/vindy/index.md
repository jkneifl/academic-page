In scientific computing, we often work with complex systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) to model real-world phenomena in fields like fluid dynamics, structural mechanics, and reaction-diffusion systems. These high-dimensional models are incredibly accurate but also computationally demanding, especially when the goal is to run repeated simulations or operate in real-time environments. This is where reduced-order modeling (ROM) comes into play.
