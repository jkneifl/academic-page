title: CROM Continoues Reduced Order Modeling
subtitle: of PDEs Using Implicit Neural Representations

# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: CROM builds a continous low-dimensional embedding for continous vector fields of PDEs themselves instead relying on a predefined discretization of the latter.

## Overview

## Examples

### Code

```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
data.head()
```


### Charts

Wowchemy supports the popular [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) format for interactive charts.

Save your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example `line-chart.json`, and then add the `{{</* chart data="line-chart" */>}}` shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.

Demo:

{{< chart data="line-chart" >}}

You might also find the [Plotly JSON Editor](http://plotly-json-editor.getforge.io/) useful.

### Math

Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the `math` option in your `config/_default/params.yaml` file.

To render _inline_ or _block_ math, wrap your LaTeX math with `{{</* math */>}}$...${{</* /math */>}}` or `{{</* math */>}}$$...$${{</* /math */>}}`, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy _math_ shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The _math_ shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)

Example **math block**:

$$
f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=1, \\
1-p_{0}^{*} & \text{if }k=0.\end{cases}
$$

{{< /math >}}

### Diagrams

Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the `diagram` option in your `config/_default/params.toml` file or by adding `diagram: true` to your page front matter.

### Todo lists

- [x] Write math example
  - [x] Write diagram example
- [ ] Do something else

### Tables

Save your spreadsheet as a CSV file in your page's folder and then render it by adding the _Table_ shortcode to your page:

### Callouts

Academic supports a [shortcode for callouts](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/writing-markdown-latex/#callouts), also referred to as _asides_, _hints_, or _alerts_. By wrapping a paragraph in `{{%/* callout note */%}} ... {{%/* /callout */%}}`, it will render as an aside.

{{% callout note %}}
A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
{{% /callout %}}

### Icons

{{< icon name="terminal" pack="fas" >}} Terminal  
{{< icon name="python" pack="fab" >}} Python  
{{< icon name="r-project" pack="fab" >}} R
