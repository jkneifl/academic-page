abstract: Generative models are transforming science and engineering by enabling efficient
  synthetization and exploration of new scenarios for complex physical phenomena with
  minimal cost. Although they provide uncertainty-aware predictions to support decision
  making, they typically lack physical consistency, which is the backbone of computational
  science. Hence, we propose VENI, VINDy, VICI – a novel physical generative framework
  that integrates data-driven system identification into a probabilistic modeling
  approach to construct physically consistent and efficient reduced-order models with
  uncertainty quantification. First, VENI (Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs) employs
  variational autoencoders to identify reduced coordinates from high-dimensional,
  noisy measurements. Simultaneously, VINDy (Variational Identification of Nonlinear
  Dynamics) extends sparse system identification methods by embedding probabilistic
  modeling into the discovery process. Last, VICI (Variational Inference with Credibility
  Intervals) enables efficient generation of full-time solutions and provides uncertainty
  quantification for unseen parameters and initial conditions. We demonstrate the
  performance of the framework across chaotic and high-dimensional nonlinear systems.
