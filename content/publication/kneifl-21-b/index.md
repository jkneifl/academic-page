abstract: Modeling and simulations are a pillar in the development of complex technical
  systems. However, for time-critical applications a conduction of high-fidelity simulations
  is not always feasible. To mitigate this computational bottleneck model order reduction
  (MOR) can be applied. For nonlinear models, linear MOR approaches are only practicable
  to a limited extend. Nonlinear approaches, on the contrary, often require deep interventions
  in the used simulation code. If access is not possible, non-intrusive nonlinear
  model order reduction can be the key to success. The goal of this work is to implement
  a non-intrusive approach using classical model order reduction along with machine
  learning algorithms. It relies on the idea to learn the dynamics in the reduced
  space. The approach aims to learn the temporal evolution of the reduced dynamics
  of a system. By applying the method to a problem arising from the field of structural
  dynamics, accurate surrogate models are received. They can speed up the simulation
  time significantly, while still providing high-quality state approximations.
