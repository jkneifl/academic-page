abstract: The simulation of many complex phenomena in engineering and science requires
  solving expensive, high-dimensional systems of partial differential equations (PDEs).
  To circumvent this, reduced-order models (ROMs) have been developed to speed up
  computations. However, when governing equations are unknown or partially known,
  typically ROMs lack interpretability and reliability of the predicted solutions.
  In this work we present a data-driven, non-intrusive framework for building ROMs
  where the latent variables and dynamics are identified in an interpretable manner
  and uncertainty is quantified. Starting from a limited amount of high-dimensional,
  noisy data the proposed framework constructs an efficient ROM by leveraging variational
  autoencoders for dimensionality reduction along with a newly introduced, variational
  version of sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), which we refer to
  as Variational Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (VINDy). In detail, the method
  consists of Variational Encoding of Noisy Inputs (VENI) to identify the distribution
  of reduced coordinates. Simultaneously, we learn the distribution of the coefficients
  of a pre-determined set of candidate functions by VINDy. Once trained offline, the
  identified model can be queried for new parameter instances and new initial conditions
  to compute the corresponding full-time solutions. The probabilistic setup enables
  uncertainty quantification as the online testing consists of Variational Inference
  naturally providing Certainty Intervals (VICI). In this work we showcase the effectiveness
  of the newly proposed VINDy method in identifying interpretable and accurate dynamical
  system for the Rössler system with different noise intensities and sources. Then
  the performance of the overall method - named VENI, VINDy, VICI - is tested on PDE
  benchmarks including structural mechanics and fluid dynamics.
