abstract: We discuss nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for multi-body dynamics
  via physics-informed machine learning methods. Physics-informed neural networks
  (PINNs) are a promising tool to approximate (partial) differential equations. PINNs
  are not suited for control tasks in their original form since they are not designed
  to handle variable control actions or variable initial values. We thus present the
  idea of enhancing PINNs by adding control actions and initial conditions as additional
  network inputs. The high-dimensional input space is subsequently reduced via a sampling
  strategy and a zero-hold assumption. This strategy enables the controller design
  based on a PINN as an approximation of the underlying system dynamics. The additional
  benefit is that the sensitivities are easily computed via automatic differentiation,
  thus leading to efficient gradient-based algorithms. Finally, we present our results
  using our PINN-based MPC to solve a tracking problem for a complex mechanical system,
  a multi-link manipulator.
