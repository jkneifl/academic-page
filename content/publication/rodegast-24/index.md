abstract: Globally, motorcycles attract vast and varied users. However, since the
  rate of severe injury and fatality in motorcycle accidents far exceeds that of passenger
  car accidents, efforts have been directed towards increasing passive safety systems.
  Impact simulations show that the risk of severe injury or death in the event of
  a motorcycle-to-car impact can be greatly reduced if the motorcycle is equipped
  with passive safety measures such as airbags and seat belts. For the passive safety
  systems to be activated, a collision must be detected within milliseconds for a
  wide variety of impact configurations, but under no circumstances may it be falsely
  triggered. For the challenge of reliably detecting impending collisions, this paper
  presents an investigation towards the applicability of machine learning algorithms.
  First, a series of simulations of accidents and driving operation is introduced
  to collect data to train machine learning classification models. Their performance
  is henceforth assessed and compared via multiple representative and application-oriented
  criteria.
