abstract: We discuss nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) for multi-body dynamics
  via physics-informed machine learning methods. In more detail, we use a physics-informed
  neural networks (PINNs)-based MPC to solve a tracking problem for a complex mechanical
  system, a multi-link manipulator. PINNs are a promising tool to approximate (partial)
  differential equations but are not suited for control tasks in their original form
  since they are not designed to handle variable control actions or variable initial
  values. We thus follow the strategy of Antonelo et al. (arXiv:2104.02556, 2021)
  by enhancing PINNs with adding control actions and initial conditions as additional
  network inputs. Subsequently, the high-dimensional input space is reduced via a
  sampling strategy and a zero-hold assumption. This strategy enables the controller
  design based on a PINN as an approximation of the underlying system dynamics. The
  additional benefit is that the sensitivities are easily computed via automatic differentiation,
  thus leading to efficient gradient-based algorithms for the underlying optimal control
  problem.
