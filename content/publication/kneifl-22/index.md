abstract: Recent research in non-intrusive data-driven model order reduction (MOR)
  enabled accurate and efficient approximation of parameterized ordinary differential
  equations (ODEs). However, previous studies have focused on constant parameters,
  whereas time-dependent parameters have been neglected. The purpose of this paper
  is to introduce a novel two-step MOR scheme to tackle this issue. In a first step,
  classic MOR approaches are applied to calculate a low-dimensional representation
  of high-dimensional ODE solutions, i.e., to extract the most important features
  of simulation data. Based on this representation, a long short-term memory (LSTM)
  is trained to predict the reduced dynamics iteratively in a second step considering
  the parameters at the respective time step. The potential of this approach is demonstrated
  on an occupant model within a car driving scenario. The reduced model's response
  to time-varying accelerations matches the reference data with high accuracy for
  a limited amount of time. Furthermore, real-time capability is achieved. Accordingly,
  it is concluded that the presented method is well suited to approximate parameterized
  ODEs and can handle time-dependent parameters in contrast to common methods.
