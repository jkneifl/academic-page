Greetings! I recently completed my PhD, focusing on scientific machine learning. My academic journey led me to the captivating world of engineering cybernetics, where I honed my skills in mathematics, mechanics, and control theory, and formed a deep interest in systems theory and understanding complex models.

In my research, I’m driven to efficiently approximate complex models by blending core numerical methods with artificial intelligence learning techniques. I’m passionate about the synergy between scientific principles and cutting-edge technologies.
